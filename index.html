               <p>The pie chart titled 'Deaths by Cause in 2017' examines the distribution of deaths across various causes, with percentages highlighting key contributors. While heart disease (13.2%) and cancer (12.2%) dominate as the leading causes, causes like unintentional injuries (3.47%) and CLRD (3.27%) also play significant roles. When examined across states, California reported the highest percentage of deaths across all 10 causes, while New York stood out with 8.53% of its deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia, a notably higher percentage compared to other states. This analysis underscores geographic variations in mortality patterns, providing insights for localized healthcare strategies and interventions.</p>

               <p>The graph titled "Deaths by Cause Over Time (1999–2016)" uses a line graph to illustrate trends in death rates for various causes over the years. While most causes saw an overall rise in death rates, notable patterns emerge: heart disease experienced an initial decrease before stabilizing, while cancer showed a slight but steady increase in deaths over time. Leading causes such as Heart Disease, Cancer, and Unintentional Injuries consistently contribute significantly to mortality, reflecting their continued public health impact. Meanwhile, chronic illnesses like Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease show gradual upward trends, signaling growing health burdens. Causes like Influenza and Pneumonia remain stable contributors to mortality. This visualization provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals, helping identify priorities for resource allocation, targeted interventions, and further research into persistent and emerging health challenges.</p>

               <p>This animated bar graph titled 'Deaths by Cause Over Time (1999–2017)' provides a closer look at changes in deaths across various causes. Around 2008, slight shifts occurred in the number of deaths for all named causes, followed by a gradual increase in deaths for most causes by approximately 2010. Notably, suicide consistently accounted for fewer deaths compared to major causes like cancer and heart disease throughout the entire period. This visualization captures both steady trends and subtle shifts, offering valuable insights into long-term mortality patterns and emerging health challenges.</p>

         <embed src="./t-viz-embed-div.html"
        type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
         <p>The graphs titled "Percentage of Deaths by Cause Across States (Top Causes)" examine the distribution of deaths by cause across different U.S. states using pie charts and percentages. California consistently had the highest percentage of deaths across all 10 causes, reflecting its large population. Notably, New York stands out with 8.53% of deaths attributed to Influenza and Pneumonia, a significant outlier compared to other states. These visualizations highlight key regional differences in mortality patterns, providing critical insights for understanding state-level health trends and informing targeted public health interventions.</p>
